David took advantage of the opportunity offered by GIPL last year for Beneficiaries to purchase Gumala investment houses. The GIPL Board is keen to see more Beneficiaries obtain their own homes and will consider sales of its residential properties in Tom Price and South Hedland to Beneficiaries. David is pictured here with Gumala Trust Executive Officer John Raftis.
