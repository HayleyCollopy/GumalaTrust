                      <p>In January, the Gumala Trust (GIPL) congradulated Gumala Beneficiary Carol Lee Tucker when she took ownership of her home in Tom Price. Carol took advantage of the opportunity offered by GIPL last year for beneficiaries to purchace Gulama investment houses. The GIPL board is keen to see more Beneficiaries obtain their homes.
